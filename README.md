# Unimocks

A library that standardizes API mocking for UI-driven development.

If you've ever done UI-driven development with a requirement for full test automation, then you've probably had to go through the tedium of setting up a mock api server for development, then using mock data in unit testing, then creating mocks for integration testing, and finally creating mock data for contract testing.

Unimocks provides you with an approach that will allow you to use the same mocks for all areas of testing and development.

## Installation

```bash
npm install unimocks
```
